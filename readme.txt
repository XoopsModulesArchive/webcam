This is a very simple module for displaying a webcam on your Xoops site.

Instructions:
1) Upload and install as normal
2) Edit webcam.php : Change $img from "http://mzsrv.zoo.org.au/webcams/butterflies.jpg" to your webcam image URL.
Don't forget to keep it enclosed in double quotes. Change $r (the refresh rate) to suit. Default is 20 (= 20 seconds).
3) Edit index.php: Change image width and height to suit your cam image.
Done!
